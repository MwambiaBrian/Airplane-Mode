### Airplane Mode

A hypothetical flight ticket system
#  Flight Ticket System â€“ Frappe Learning App

Welcome to the **Flight Ticket System**, a learning-based project designed to help  understand how to model real-world business workflows using the **Frappe Framework** (the foundation of ERPNext). 

This app walks  through modeling a simple flight ticketing process while introducing powerful Frappe concepts along the way.
